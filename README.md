# How Rainbows Are Formed: A Physics Explanation

Have you ever looked up after a rainstorm and seen a beautiful arc of colors across the sky? That’s a **rainbow** — a natural light show created by the interaction of **sunlight** and **water droplets**. But what exactly causes this colorful phenomenon? The answer lies in **physics**.

## What Conditions Are Needed?

To see a rainbow, three basic conditions must be met:

- **Sunlight** (usually low in the sky)
- **Water droplets** in the air (rain, mist, or spray)
- **Observer** with the sun behind them

When these conditions are just right, light interacts with the droplets to produce the rainbow.

## The Physics Behind a Rainbow

The formation of a rainbow involves three main physical processes:

### 1. **Refraction**
When sunlight enters a water droplet, it **bends** because light changes speed when moving from air to water. This bending is called **refraction**.

### 2. **Dispersion**
As light refracts, it **splits into its component colors** because each color bends by a slightly different amount. This separation of white light into colors is known as **dispersion**.

### 3. **Reflection**
Inside the droplet, light reflects off the **back surface** of the droplet and travels back toward the front.

### 4. **Refraction (Again)**
As the reflected light exits the droplet, it refracts again, further separating the colors.

## Why Do We See Different Colors?

The angle at which the light exits the droplet determines the **color** we see:

- **Red light** exits at an angle of about **42°**
- **Violet light** exits at about **40°**

The result is a **circular arc** of colors with **Red on the outside** and **Violet on the inside**:  
**ROYGBIV** – Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet

## Are Rainbows Really Arcs?

Yes and no! A rainbow is actually a **full circle** of light, but we usually only see the upper arc because the ground blocks the bottom half. If you're in a plane or on a mountain, you might see a **full circular rainbow**.

## Fun Facts

- **Double rainbows** occur when light reflects twice inside the droplet — the second arc has reversed colors!
- Rainbows can also appear in **spray from waterfalls**, **fountains**, or even **lawn sprinklers**.
